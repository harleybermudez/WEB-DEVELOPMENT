        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Demon realm</i> is a place where the forsaken lives, the condition is harsh chaotic, plane opposite of the <i>overworld</i> that we know.<br><br>
            In this deserted place a demon is what so called the inhabitant—demons are evil that desires power, world domination and to wreak havoc.<br><br>
            With the few resources they have on the <i>underworld</i>, demons desire for power grew even bigger. There for demons have gathered and planned an attack.<br><br>
            There gathered thousands of demons flooding out through the gates of hell marching and devastating everything on their path, killing people, destroying their homes. Devasting their crops and killing their livestock humanity is bound to fall.<br><br>
            Some may describe this as “like a big scary flood of monsters coming out at once”
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 2</h2>
        <p>
            Humanity is devastated if nothing is done, humanity may cease to exist so, they prayed to the gods all day all night long until the gods gave them a prophecy <u><b style="color:#2980b9;">6 bald babies</b></u> is going to be born.<br><br>
            There humanity search for the <u><b style="color:#2980b9;">6 bald babies</b></u> like a dragon ball.<br><br>
            A year later still no babies to be found but then 2 months past a baby that is shining and blazingly bald appears
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 3</h2>
        <p>
            After two months another baby is found, and this cycle repeats until <u><b style="color:#2980b9;">6 baby</b></u> is born in the span of a year.<br><br>
            The babies grew rapidly as they are blessed by gods, they have increased strength incomparable to a normal human not only that they are agile and they can fly too, but the most important part is their shining bright bald heads can cleanse the evil.<br><br>
            Their shiny bald head can emit a ray of light that can cut through anything it can also form a light barrier that can protect people.
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 4</h2>
        <p>
            15 years later humanity is holding on for there dear life, clinging to the hope that <u><b style="color:#2980b9;">Glow Squad</b></u> will defeat the demons.<br><br>
            <u><b style="color:#2980b9;">Glow Squad</b></u> began their journey of slaughter the demons as soon as they turn 15. Demons stood no chance.<br><br>
            After a one and half years battling the <u><b style="color:#27ae60;">baldy MF</b></u> has done it… they defeated all the demons that linger on the <i>overworld</i>.
        </p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Chapter 5</h2>
        <p>
            And that’s how <u><b style="color:#27ae60;">bald people</b></u> began their mark on the world, heroes that save the world.
